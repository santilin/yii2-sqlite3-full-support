# yii2-sqlite3-full-support

Adds support for unsupported sqlite3 ALTER TABLE comands to Yii2 following the procedures stated at https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html#otheralter

Provides also a seamlessly translation of MySQL expressions into sqlite expressions.

Manages DDL statements with attached databases

## Done
- Expression translating:
  - NOW() => 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'
- Drop column
- Alter column
- Add foreign key
- Rename column
- Add primary key
- Drop foreign key (works with migrate/refresh which passes index of foreign key instead of name)
- Drop Unique

## Todo
- Drop Primary key
- Add Check
- Drop Check
- Add default value
- Drop default value
- Add comment on column
- Drop comment from column
- Add Comment on table
- Drop comment from table
- buildSubqueryInCondition

# Install

    require "santilin/yii2-sqlite3-full-support": "*"

# Usage

The extension works out of the box without any configuration.
The boostrap of this extension replaces the className of yii\db\sqlite\QueryBuilder to point to this custom QueryBuilder.

# Caveats
## Foreign key disabling
When using `safeUp` and `safeDown` in a migration that includes `Drop column`, `Alter column`, `Add foreign key`, `Rename column` and `Drop foreign key` the migration fails because the `pragma foreignkeys` only works outside transactions. You have to use `up` and `down` instead in your migration. A exception is thrown if foreign keys can not be disabled. 

You can force the migration even if foreign keys can not be disabled defining the environment variable YII2_SQLITE3_NO_TRANS.

## migrate/fresh
The command `migrate/fresh` drops all foreign keys prior to dropping tables. As the migrate controller doesn't send the name of the foreign key, but the number of foreign key instead in ascending order, the foreign keys are not dropped properly. To fix this, you have to change this line of code:

```
diff --git a/db/sqlite/Schema.php b/db/sqlite/Schema.php
index c8898d817..2e30e823f 100644
--- a/db/sqlite/Schema.php

$keys = $this->db->createCommand($sql)->queryAll();
-        foreach ($keys as $key) {
+        foreach (array_reverse($keys) as $key) {
$id = (int) $key['id'];
if (!isset($table->foreignKeys[$id])) {
$table->foreignKeys[$id] = [$key['table'], $key['from'] => $key['to']];
```

# TODO
* Check in which version was ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN added to sqlite3
